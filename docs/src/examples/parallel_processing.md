# Parallel Processing

This example demonstrates how to use parallel processing for analyzing large datasets.

## Setup

First, let's set up our project directory and load the package:

```julia
using StochasticGene

# Create project directory
rna_setup("parallel_example")
cd("parallel_example")
```

## Setting Up Parallel Processing

Initialize parallel processing with the desired number of workers:

```julia
# Set up parallel processing
setup_parallel(nworkers=4)  # Adjust based on your system
```

## Fitting Models in Parallel

### Basic Parallel Fitting

```julia
# Fit multiple models in parallel
fits = fit_parallel(
    G = 2,
    R = 0,
    transitions = ([1,2], [2,1]),
    datatype = "rna",
    datapath = "data/",
    gene = "MYC",
    nchains = 4  # Number of parallel chains
)
```

### Hierarchical Parallel Fitting

```julia
# Fit hierarchical models in parallel
fits = fit_hierarchical(
    G = 2,
    R = 0,
    transitions = ([1,2], [2,1]),
    datatype = "rna",
    datapath = "data/",
    gene = "MYC",
    nchains = 4,
    hierarchical = true
)
```

## Analyzing Results

Let's examine the parallel fitting results:

```julia
# Print basic statistics
println(stats)

# Plot the results
using Plots
plot(fits)

# Save results
save_results(fits, "results/")
```

## Advanced Usage

### Cluster Computing

For large-scale analysis on a computing cluster:

```julia
# Set up cluster-specific parameters
setup_parallel(
    nworkers = 16,
    cluster = true,
    memory_limit = "4G"
)

# Run large-scale analysis
fits = fit_parallel(
    G = 2,
    R = 0,
    transitions = ([1,2], [2,1]),
    datatype = "rna",
    datapath = "data/",
    gene = "MYC",
    nchains = 16
)
```

### Resource Management

Monitor and manage parallel resources:

```julia
# Check worker status
check_workers()

# Clean up resources
cleanup_parallel()
```

## Best Practices

1. **Resource Allocation**
   - Match worker count to available CPU cores
   - Consider memory requirements per worker
   - Monitor system load

2. **Error Handling**
   - Implement proper error handling for parallel tasks
   - Log errors and warnings
   - Implement retry mechanisms

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Use appropriate chunk sizes
   - Balance load across workers
   - Monitor memory usage

## Next Steps

- Try different parallel configurations
- Experiment with hierarchical models
- Scale up to cluster computing
